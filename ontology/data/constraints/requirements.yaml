  # Monitoring requirements
  - source_id: metformin
    target_id: reduced_egfr
    strength: strong
    evidence: "Renal function must be assessed before and during metformin therapy"
    # note: this is a monitoring requirement, not a treatment relationship

  # State requirements
  - source_id: gestational_diabetes
    target_id: pregnant
    strength: absolute
    evidence: "Gestational diabetes by definition requires pregnancy"

  - source_id: preeclampsia
    target_id: pregnant
    strength: absolute
    evidence: "Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific condition"

  - source_id: fetal_macrosomia
    target_id: pregnant
    strength: absolute
    evidence: "Fetal findings require pregnancy"

  # Clinical monitoring requirements using findings
