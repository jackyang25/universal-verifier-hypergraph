# Verified Clinical Contexts Configuration
#
# Each verified context represents a HYPEREDGE in the clinical knowledge graph.
# A hyperedge connects a set of patient conditions to a formally verified protocol.
#
# Proof Types:
#   - independent: Single condition, base protocol
#   - compositional: Multiple conditions, coordinates compatible base protocols
#   - interaction: Multiple conditions, resolves conflicts with specialized protocol
